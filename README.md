# NASA-Space-Apps

This code is a part of the project that my team and I had made for the **'NASA Space Apps Challenge 2020'** our topic was **'What is our Carbon Footprint'** and the program we made is a simple C language program that calculates the number of trees that is needed in a certain area to balance the carbon emissions of that region. We also did a detailes presentation to spread awareness about the carbon footprint of a person, how much carbon do the industries emit and its harmful effects. We went on to win the First round on-campus and get selected as a **Global Nominee**.
